## Homework List

Website Link: https://a4-brittany-ficarra-production.up.railway.app/

For this assignment I ported my A3 over to React.js. Overall nothing was added and it works the same, some of the code just had to be adjusted due to being moved over to React. The project still allows the user to add and delete homework assignments to a list that is stored per user in the MongoDB database.

The new technology I felt hinderted the development exerience because it had been previosly programmed without React. If React had been used from the beginning then I think it would have been a much more enjoyable experience.
