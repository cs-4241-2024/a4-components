The new technology hindered some parts of development experience.
I was aiming for removing the usage of window.onload but due to time constraints was unable to do that.
But the idea of components is very good to keep things modular and readable instead of having only one file to do everything.
Using useState to open and close modal is very frustrating to do. Some things I did was using functional components. Moved associated functions of each component within associated jsx file.
Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
