## Assignment 4: To Do List with Priorities

http://a4-sophia-kalavantis.glitch.me

For this project, I re-implemented my to-do list app from A2 using React components.
The main changes that I did were just breaking the original functionality into React components: App.js, TaskForm.js, TaskList.js, and Task.js.
Instead of manipulating the DOM like I did with the original main.js, React does all that work through the components, and the form elements are now inside TaskForm.js.
The index.html just has a simple div for React to render, and all DOM stuff is done by React now.

React gives a more structured way of organizing code but it hindered my development experience overall. The CSS that originally worked perfectly with HTML and JavaScript didnâ€™t apply as well to the new components.
Also, more files are now in my codebase to essentially do the same tasks that I had before, which made the code more complex without really improving functionality.
