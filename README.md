I implemented my a3 project using React. Nothing was changed significantly except the removal of the middleware that sends unauthenticated users to the login page (essentially, you will need to login each time you open a new window, but it will still remember if you logged in with the current window you are using), and the layout of the webpages visually. The new technology improved some aspects of the project, but it also hindered some others to the point where it caused significant delays with making progress on the project.
