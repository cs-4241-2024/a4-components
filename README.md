## A4-Todo List app

Deployment link (from a3): https://a3-jeffcli-fcc7491c5e77.herokuapp.com/


My project has essentially stayed the same since A2 functionality wise. It is a TodoList app where you are able to create an account, sign in, create tasks with varying names, descriptions and priorities and a due date will be generated given the priority of the task. For this iteration, I used react for the frontend, instead of standard HTML/CSS. In general, this is a lot better as the frontend is greatly simplified and better organized but I personally ran into a multitude of issues during development with both setting up the project and getting my app to render. Particularly, my servers were repeatedly referencing the wrong directories causing my app to not render and this persisted despite changing my project structure multiple times. I was obviously unable to deploy my app because of this. Therefore for now I would say that this new technology hindered my development experience as I was unable to produce a working app. I will continue to work on this to try to get this issue resolved, but this is what I have as of now on 9/30, 11:59AM.
