## Company XYZ Employee Form With React

For this assignment, I used my code from Assignment 2 to make a React app. I kept the server and front-end logic the same, but used an App.js, as that is normally what I am used to doing when developing in React. For my CSS code, I left everything there mostly untouched. In general, I found that using React helped to minimize the number of files for the project, which makes it easier to "proofread" code and lowers the chance for small bugs and issues.
