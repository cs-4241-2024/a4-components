## Changes & Improvements

For this project, I migrated the original vehicle form and table management from a plain Node.js/Express setup to a modern React/Vite-based frontend. I incorporated React state management for handling form inputs and dynamically updating the vehicle table, while the Express backend serves as an API for CRUD operations. This structure improved development by making the UI more interactive, with automatic re-renders on state changes.

The new technology improved the development experience, especially with React's component-based structure and Vite's fast build times. The visual difference is also notable, as React allows for a more dynamic and responsive user interface, making the app feel smoother and more modern compared to the traditional static HTML rendering in Node.js.

For instance, in Assignment 2, the frontend looked archaic and lacked modernity that we are used to being served by websites we visit everyday. The new implementation is in-line with these modern websites, and loads at speeds we are used to seeing across the board.
