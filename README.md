Here I added in reach to my previous assignment to make the frontend look better. I believe the new technology (react) helped my game because the UI was more neater in my opinion. Furthermore, React makes it easier to deal with different states in the game. 

Since my game was not able to be uploaded to glitch, the way you run it locally is first do "node server.js" and in another terminal do "npm run dev", then click on the link that shows up in the terminal where you ran npm run dev.
