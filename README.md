I added react components to the main page of Assignment 2. The page now updates somewhat as intended when users submit the things they like, all only on client-side. Figuring out React function components caused me a bit of trouble, but I can see how they could be useful for larger projects. It was also difficult working on development in VSCode and then switching to distribution on Glitch. Since this was a learning experience, I felt more hindered than helped, but now that I'm more familiar, I feel like React/Vite projects will make things much easier for me going forwards.
