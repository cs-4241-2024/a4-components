## Workout Tracker



Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

This project allows you to enter logs for your workouts by filling out a form. You can select what body part you worked on, the date, start time and end time. Based on the start and end time, it calculates the total minutes spend working out.
I re-implemented my A2 assignment using react, vite and express. The new technology was tough to implement and hindered the development experience. If I had more experience with it, I thinnk it would improve the experience.
