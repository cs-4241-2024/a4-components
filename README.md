I started with my assignment 2 and then made changes from there to implement it using react.
The new technology improved my experience. It was a lot easier to implement react on a project that already exsisted. I liked how with react everytime I made a change and saved I didn't need to restart the command in the terminal. While with "node.js server" I would have to restart the server everytime I made changes there.
