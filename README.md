## My Computer Science Assignments :)
This project is a single-page web application that allows users to manage their computer science assignments. Users can add new assignments, view the list of current assignments, edit existing assignments, and delete assignments. The application uses a form to submit data and dynamically updates the displayed data without requiring a page reload. The assignments include details such as the assignment name, points, score, and difficulty level.

- This project re-implements the client-side portion of Assignment 2 using React components. The main changes include converting the data display and updating functionalities into React components, which allows for a more modular and maintainable code structure. The form and table for data input and display were refactored into separate React components.

- Using React improved the development experience by providing a clear and structured way to manage the UI components and their state. The component-based architecture made the code more organized and easier to debug. However, setting up the initial environment with Webpack and Babel required additional configuration and a lot of personal time and setup. It also required many additional js files to run smoothly.
