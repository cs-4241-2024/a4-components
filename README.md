Glitch : https://glitch.com/edit/#!/a4-andrew-cash


My project allows the user to store classmates contact info. I adapted this from my a2 project,
but I also included database connection so the names don't go away after the server is ended. I changed How my html is created
using the new react features to build my table as I do. I adapted all my request functions to work
with react. 

I think for a project of this scale this hindered the development experience. This is just because it took a while
to get used too and understand how React works. But I learned the benefits of using for a larger scale project. Hosting this on glitch also gave me a lot of trouble. I finally got it to work after running a build on it in the glitch terminal.
