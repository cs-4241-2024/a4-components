## Clicker Game on React

I ended up changing assignment 2 because I couldn't figure out how to get my MongoDB server working on react. Learning to use react was difficult and instead of transfering the project I just built a new one from the ground up. The react app seems to load much quicker but other than that I do not notice many differences.
