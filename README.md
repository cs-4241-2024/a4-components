Assignment 4 - Components

## To-DO List

From assignment 3 I kept most things the same. The big changes were just integrating with React and Vite-Express which was all done within the code itself and not the UI. Within the UI I made the table smaller but still overall the same functionality. When it came to integrating with React, that was rather difficult for me but after watching many tutorials and reading about React it made it much simplier to integrate what I already had into a react format. I think I just found a lot of difficulty when it came to the login screen and also the to do list screen while also using the vite-express and react back end. I did try to implement the login without react but found it more confusing to try and use two different backends. I defintly could have been taking the wrong approach, but I am stil satisfied with what I have now and will do more research when it comes to the final project.

I did discover and use the componentDidMount functionality within react vs useEffect purely because I thought the syntax was more straightforward and their functionality seemed similar enough to interchange the two. Again a reason that was purely for my ability to read my code a little easier. componentDidMount also seemed to be much more simple to use when dealing with simple data such as a to do list.
