## Restaurant Service (Quick-Bites from A2 assignment)

This project is derived from my A2 assignment, which is an early iteration of QuickBites. The technology used in this assignment was React, Vite, and Express. I used the same functionalities that was in A3 and implemented in the A2 version of Quick-Bites. However, I had to reorganize the client-side of the application to use the React Framework.
I personally think that the React Framework improved the readability and organization of different components which made up the entirety of the front-end of the application. Not only that, the separation of files for different components allowed me to debug each individual function rather than looking at an entire block of code.
Overall, my development experience with this assignment was good, but there were hills when it came to translating the client-side of the application from HTML to React.


**Glitch**: https://honey-crystal-paranthodon.glitch.me
- I was using ViteExpress to connect to the server at first, but had to resort to using export.static to connect to the server from 'dist'. Both the repository and glitch deployment reflect that change.
