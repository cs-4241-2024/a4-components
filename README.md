This project is a web application of a guest list book for big events. You would be able to see who invited who and only the person that invited that person can remove that guest. When a person attends the event they can 
check in by the check in button. The main goal of the application is to keep track of all your guest and if they attended the event. 

The difference of this web application from A3 is that React and Vite is implemented into the application. During this process it was pain implementing react and vite to the application because alot of code needed to be changed.
On the other hand when testing the application it was Reach and Vite implementation was very useful as it automatically updates the live website based on whatever is saved.
