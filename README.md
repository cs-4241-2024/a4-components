## Student Gradebook System

Link to project: <http://a4-alden-cutler.onrender.com>

This project is a web-based application for managing student grades. I started by copying over the files from A2, then moved the entire application to use Vite/React/Express instead of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

Overall, I feel like the new technologies significantly improved the development process. Using Vite made it so I didn't have to manually restart the server every time I made a change, which was very helpful. I also like using React and TypeScript; in a way they feel more robust than vanilla web development. For small projects like this it doens't make a huge difference, but I like being able to have type checking built-in so I know I can't accidentally pass the wrong thing to a function or component.
