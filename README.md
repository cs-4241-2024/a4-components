## Game Wishlist

James Cannon https://a4-james-cannon.glitch.me

This project is an implementation of my A2 project using React and Vite-Express components. It is almost functionally identical, being a wishlist where the user can input a game and its info into a wishlist and delete games from it as well. The only differences are some alignment changes and replacement of some text inputs with number inputs. In terms of code, I had to restructure both the client and server side, with the client changed to use React and the server changed to use Express like in A3.

I would say the new technology I used improved my development experience. Once I finally started to understand React, I realized how much it could simplify client-side functions by having them interact directly with my HTML. This also simplified my server-side code, especially when combined with Express to eliminate http and mime. The main reason I chose to re-implement A2 over A3 was because the database technology severely hindered me, but React and Express by themselves seemed far more useful and intuitive to me.
