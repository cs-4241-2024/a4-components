Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
I based my assignment on the a2 version, so I did not reimpliment the login functionalities. I would say that this seems a lot better, sincce you could see in real tiem after something was changed the effects it would have on the page and made said changes swiftly. It was a lot more difficult to manipulate the css of the site, which is why the table still mimics the exact same functionalities as the origional, however the boxes dont always line up. But the additional data implimentation as well as removing previous data are exactly as they were before, and were a little confusing on how to reimpliment since there was much different wording to preform the same actions.
