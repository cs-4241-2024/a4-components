## Inflation Over Time

https://a4-ryan-wright.glitch.me/

My project here is a basic application that displays two forms and a table, where the user may enter a 
product, the year the product was released, and the initial cost of the product, and the table will
then display a list of products entered by the user, reflecting their current cost today given the year
of release and the initial cost of the product. I decided to change A2 instead of A3, simply because there was less to change on A2. In my opinion, the new technology definitely hindered the development experience. I found it much more difficult transitioning to using React compared to the previous development technologies. Additionally, I had a lot of trouble trying to get my application to run in
Glitch, and I still haven't gotten it running in Glitch yet - it runs through vite-express-project in
the VSCode terminal but I haven't gotten it running through Glitch. I tried using some of the suggestions
in the Discord but I ended up getting more errors - probably messed something up in VSCode before I
imported to Glitch.
