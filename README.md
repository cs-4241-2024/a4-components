## a4-krsiegall - Snake Game

(Leaderboard seems to not work through vercel but does work locally with `npm run dev`)

Basically just a reimplementation of A2, with NES.css and some small changes I made for A3, but using React.

Transitioning to the new tech caused a lot of bugs, to the point where it would have probably been easier to just restart. Alas, I was stubborn, and with the help of Parker and Akim, I fixed the mission critical bugs, and got everything working thereafter. 

This project uses ViteExpress to serve files, Expressjs to handle get/post requests, and React for the front end
