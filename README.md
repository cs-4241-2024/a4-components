Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

In my project, I restructured the entire application by copying all directories and files from Assignment 2 and redesigning them using React and Vite Express. The mood tracker enables users to input their current emotions, creating a mood log that includes their name or nickname, current mood, optional comments, timestamps, and a built-in mood score calculated based on their emotional input. The mood logs are displayed in a user-friendly table format, allowing users to delete logs as needed. While I maintained the core functionality from Assignment 2, the introduction of React significantly enhanced the application's architecture. The backend leverages Vite Express, a powerful web framework that simplifies backend development. This new technology stack dramatically improved my development experience, allowing me to perform simple CRUD operations with significantly fewer lines of code.

Transitioning to React required some initial learning, particularly in understanding how to combine HTML and JavaScript, as well as mastering concepts like state management, hooks, and dynamic rendering. The index.html file is notably sparse, as React dynamically renders content through the App.jsx file, enabling me to focus my efforts on a single, organized file structure. Overall, my experience with React was incredibly rewarding; it became evident that Meta designed it to facilitate the development of full-stack web applications. Its modular and reusable UI components promote clean coding practices, making it easier to maintain and scale the application over time.
