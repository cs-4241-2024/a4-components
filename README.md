## The simplest clicker game, in React

http://a4-empollak.glitch.me

This project is a re-write of my A2 in React. It is a very simple clicker game where you press a single button as many times as you can. You can then enter your name to save your score or edit your previous score. You can also delete your previous score by entering the same name and pressing delete.

Using React made the development much easier. I did not have to deal with editing the DOM manually, as I could just have my components depend on the state of the score array. I did have a bit of a learning curve, but once I understood how it all worked it was much easier to implement the functionality.
