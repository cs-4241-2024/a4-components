My project has stayed mostly the same since A2. The differences here include the new react App, and how the data is dynamically added. Although this new technology took a lot of time to end up working correctly, I beleive this ends up being more simple than HTML. Once things keep getting added to the site I can see how basic JS and HTML do not compete with React.
I ran into a lot of issues that took longer to solve during this process, but it was very informative and a great learning process!
