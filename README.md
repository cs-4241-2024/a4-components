## Grocery List

https://a4-harshith-iyer.up.railway.app

This is a simple web application that allows users to add grocery items to a list. The user can then view the list and edit the items as needed. The application also allows the user to delete items from the list. The application is built using React and is hosted on Railway. I turned the grocery list and add item sections of the website into separate components to make it easier to manage and maintain. The new technology improved the development experience in a few ways: it made the code more modular and easier to mantain, and I've used React extensively before, so I'm familiar with the syntax and the best practices. However, I ran into some issues with TypeScript issues while transferring the old code to the new code, which made it slightly more annoying to work with. Overall, for such a simple application, I would use regular HTML/CSS/JS, and for more complex applications, I would use React.
