My project is the same as what I did for assignment 3, AKA a website where you can store video game scores. 
The new technology improved the development experience for me. 
Although a little finnicky when setting up, I did enjoy using functional components. 
I like how reusable they are, and how compatmentalized you can make your code. 
Also, although I didn't implement styling, I know it wouldve been easier to make general styling rules for similar components which was nice to know. 
I took away the link for tetris, but I added a logout button. 
Other than that, I did not change much.
