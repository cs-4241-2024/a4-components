**Instructions**:
- **Goal of the Application**: This project is a Weekly Todo List application that allows users to add, modify, and manage tasks efficiently. the application uses Flexbox for positioning the form elements,

- Add a Task: Fill in the task name, select a due date, choose a priority level, and click the "Add Task" button to add a new task to the list. Modify a Task: Enter the existing task name you wish to modify, then provide the new details (task name, due date, priority), and click the "Modify Task" button. View Tasks: All tasks are displayed in a table format under "Current Tasks," showing the task name, due date, priority, days remaining, and options to edit or delete tasks.
- If the user enters a pre-existing account, the site will record what has been entered, and if it is a non-existing account it will automatically register.
**Achievements**:
-deployed by using render, is much easy then using glitch 
- five Express middleware packages:
express-session: Used to manage user sessions, allowing persistent login across multiple requests without requiring a password each time.
cors: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which allows the server to respond to requests from different origins, crucial for web applications that interact with APIs or other domains.
body-parser: Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, supporting different types like JSON and URL-encoded data.
morgan: A logging middleware that logs HTTP requests in a customizable format, useful for monitoring and debugging during development.
cookie-parser: Parses cookies attached to client requests, allowing for easier handling of cookies in your Express app.

- W3C
- Use clear and simple language-Basically, all the words used are simple single words.
- Provide informative, unique page titles
- sufficient contrast between text and background
- Use responsive design
- Design clear and consistent navigation
- Make error messages clear



- Contrast
  Contrast on the site is used to make the most important parts stand out visually. For example, on the login page, the "Login" button is the most eye-catching element. It's dark blue with white text, so it really pops compared to the rest of the page. On the task page, the headings like "Your Todo List" also use this dark blue to make them stand out. In the task table, the headers are dark with white text, which makes them easy to distinguish from the lighter rows of tasks. This use of contrast helps users quickly find what they need, like buttons to click or sections to read. It’s especially helpful for people who might struggle with visual differences.

Repetition
Repetition is used to keep the site looking consistent and familiar. For instance, the same dark blue color and font are used for buttons and headings across all pages. This repetition makes the site feel uniform, so users know what to expect when moving from one page to another. The "Login" button on the login page looks the same as the "Add Task" button on the task page, so users can easily recognize interactive elements. This repeated design helps create a sense of order and makes the website easier to use because everything feels connected and consistent.

Alignment
Alignment helps keep things neat and organized on the site. On both the login and task pages, everything is centered, making it easy to follow. For example, the input fields and buttons on the login form are stacked in a straight line, making it clear where users should type and click. On the task page, the table with tasks is left-aligned, making it easy to read task names and due dates. By keeping everything aligned, the site looks clean and professional, and it also helps certain things, like buttons, stand out more. This makes the page easy to navigate and visually pleasing.

Proximity
Proximity is used to group related items together, making the layout easier to understand. For example, on the task page, the fields for adding or modifying a task (like "Task Name" and "Due Date") are close to each other. This shows that these fields are part of the same process. The tasks that are already added are in a separate table, making it clear that they are different from the forms where new tasks are added. Similarly, on the login page, the username field and login button are grouped together, so it’s obvious they belong to the same action. Grouping things this way helps users understand the layout better without being confused about where to go or what to do.
